# GPyEm
A wrapper for GPyTorch that creates independent multi-output Gaussian process emulators

# Installation
## If you just want to use it...
```
pip install git+https://github.com/cwlanyon/GPyEm.git
```

## If you want to develop it...

Go to where you want to save your repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/cwlanyon/GPyEm.git
pip install -e GPyEm
```
So you can now import this in a python script anywhere you happen to be (no need to worry about paths etc):
```
from GPyEm import GPE_ensemble as GPE
```

## If you already have the repo on your computer...

Go to the location. E.g.
```
cd /home/me/Documents/code/GPyEm
```
Then call:
```
pip install -e .
```

Enjoy!
